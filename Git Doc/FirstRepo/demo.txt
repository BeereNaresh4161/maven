Head and Tail Commands
===============

Cat ---- Print data from top to bottom(Total file)
Tac---- Print data from bottom to top(Total file)

Head --- It is used to print data from top to bottom
        --- Bydefault it prints first 10 lines of a file

Tail ---- It is used to print data from bottom to top
        --- Bydefault it prints last 10 lines of a file


Head and Tail Commands are very useful to trouble shoot the log files
i.e Latest logs will be available at the bottom

Log files data will be some thousands of lines, so cat and tac commands will display all lines
so we are not preffered these commands.

we will use head and tail commands with specifi line data of a file

$head <filename>   --- reads first 10 lines of a file bydefault
$tail <filename>  ----- reads last 10 lines of a file bydefault

$head sbi.log  ---- reads first 10 lines

$head -n 25 sbi.log ---- reads first 25 lines

$head -n 50 sbi.log ---- reads first 50 lines


$tail sbi.log  ---- reads last 10 lines

$tail -n 25 sbi.log ---- reads last 25 lines

$tail +50 sbi.log ---- reads from 50th line to bottom
